Demo of app: https://lnkd.in/e_fui4-p
front end + back end repo: https://lnkd.in/ePDVEwff

I created all backend fucntioanlly of this applciation in this repo through djnago. 
Personally handled:
Shelter Information: The backend will interface with databases that store real-time updates on shelter availability, including beds, food, water, and medical supplies.
APIs for Real-time Data: To ensure real-time updates, the backend can integrate with external APIs for live weather conditions, road closures, and evacuation routes.
Crowdsourcing Features: The backend will support user-generated data, allowing individuals to report temporary shelters or community resources.
Community Interaction: Users can check in, share vital resources, and coordinate with others. The backend would handle messaging, posting, and notification features to ensure smooth communication.
Geolocation Services: By using location data, users can connect with nearby shelters, individuals, or resources based on their location.
Shelters and Supplies: The database will track shelter locations, current capacity, and available resources (beds, food, water, medical supplies).
User Activity: This includes user-generated data like check-ins, shared resources, and crowdsourced shelters.
